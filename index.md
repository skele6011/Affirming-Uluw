**"If I were asked about Allah, Blessed and Exalted, I would say: He is in the heaven. If it is said: ‘Where was His Throne before (He created) the heaven?’ I would say: ‘On the water.’ If it is said: ‘Where was His Throne before the water?’ I would say: ‘I do not know.’"**

⦿ {Sheikh Adil Mentioned the Ijmā that Imām Al-Bukhārī and Imām ibn Abī Ḥātim Transmitted in his book}

**Muḥammad ibn Ismā’īl al-Bukhārī (d. 256 AH) رحمه الله said: “I met more than a thousand men from among the people of knowledge: the people of Ḥijāz, Mecca, Medina, and Kufa… I met them repeatedly, generation after generation… I encountered them while they were abundant, for more than forty-six years…” Then he mentioned the names of the scholars he met in those regions and then said: “We sufficed with naming these to keep it brief… I did not see any one of them differing on these matters…” He mentioned the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah, including his statement: “The Qur’an is the speech of Allah, not created,” citing the verse: “Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He covers the night with the day, chasing it rapidly…”** _(Al-A’raf: 54)._

_[Narrated by Al-Lālakā’ī (292)]_

⦿ {Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī Ḥātim, may Allāh have mercy on them both, said:}

**"I asked my father (d. 277 AH) and Abū Zurʿah (d. 264 AH) about the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah (the people of the Sunnah) in the fundamentals of the religion, and about what they found the scholars upon in all the regions, and what they themselves believed regarding that.

They said: “We found the scholars in all the regions—Ḥijāz, ʿIrāq, Shām, and Yemen—and part of their creed was...”They then mentioned the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah in most of the chapters of creed, including:

That Allāh is above His Throne, separate from His creation, as He described Himself in His Book and on the tongue of His Messenger (ﷺ), without [asking] how; He encompasses everything in knowledge {There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing} [Qurʾān, 42:11]. And that He, blessed and exalted, will be seen in the Hereafter... They will hear His speech however He wills, and in whatever manner He wills... until the end of the creed."**
