## Firstly, I'll be using the Qur'an.

**"If I were asked about Allah, Blessed and Exalted, I would say: He is in the heaven. If it is said: ‘Where was His Throne before (He created) the heaven?’ I would say: ‘On the water.’ If it is said: ‘Where was His Throne before the water?’ I would say: ‘I do not know.’"**

⦿ {Sheikh Adil Mentioned the Ijmā that Imām Al-Bukhārī and Imām ibn Abī Ḥātim Transmitted in his book}

**Muḥammad ibn Ismā’īl al-Bukhārī (d. 256 AH) رحمه الله said: “I met more than a thousand men from among the people of knowledge: the people of Ḥijāz, Mecca, Medina, and Kufa… I met them repeatedly, generation after generation… I encountered them while they were abundant, for more than forty-six years…” Then he mentioned the names of the scholars he met in those regions and then said: “We sufficed with naming these to keep it brief… I did not see any one of them differing on these matters…” He mentioned the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah, including his statement: “The Qur’an is the speech of Allah, not created,” citing the verse: “Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He covers the night with the day, chasing it rapidly…”** _(Al-A’raf: 54)._

_[Narrated by Al-Lālakā’ī (292)]_

⦿ {Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī Ḥātim, may Allāh have mercy on them both, said:}

**"I asked my father (d. 277 AH) and Abū Zurʿah (d. 264 AH) about the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah (the people of the Sunnah) in the fundamentals of the religion, and about what they found the scholars upon in all the regions, and what they themselves believed regarding that.

They said: “We found the scholars in all the regions—Ḥijāz, ʿIrāq, Shām, and Yemen—and part of their creed was...”They then mentioned the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah in most of the chapters of creed, including:

That Allāh is above His Throne, separate from His creation, as He described Himself in His Book and on the tongue of His Messenger (ﷺ), without [asking] how; He encompasses everything in knowledge {There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing} [Qurʾān, 42:11]. And that He, blessed and exalted, will be seen in the Hereafter... They will hear His speech however He wills, and in whatever manner He wills... until the end of the creed."**

{Imām Ad-Dhahābi reported:}

**"Ka'b al-Ahbar said that a man came to him while he was among a group of people. Ka'b said: "Let the man be, for if he is ignorant, he may learn, and if he is knowledgeable, he may increase in knowledge." Then Ka'b said: 'I will inform you that Allah created seven heavens, and from the earth, their like. Then He made the distance between each pair of heavens as the distance between the heaven and the earth, and He made their density like that. Then He raised the Throne and ascended over it.'"**

{Imām Aṭ-Ṭabarī says:}

**"The Most Merciful (Al-Rahman) established Himself over (istawā ’alā) the Throne and ascended over (’alā ’alayhi) it, and that was on Saturday as has been said."**

{‘Abd Al-‘Azīz ibn Yaḥyā Al-Kinānī Ash-Shāfi‘ī (رحمه الله) [d.243H] said in his book Ar-Radd ‘ala Az-Zanādiqah wa Al-Jahmiyyah (The response to the heretics and the Jahmiyyah):}

**“The chapter concerning the saying of the Jahmi regarding the Statement of Allah, the Exalted: «Ar-Raḥmān Istawā (rose) over the Throne.» [Quran 20:5] That the meaning is: Istawlā (Took over/Conquered), like the saying of the Arabs: Fulān (so-and-so) conquered Egypt, Fulān conquered Ash-Shām (Syria, Jordan, etc.). He (the Jahmi) wants it as: Istawlā (Took over/conquered) it (the Throne).**

**Then the explanation for that is to say to him: Is there any creation of Allah's Ta‘ālā creations that has passed a period of time without Allah being in control over it? If he then says: “No.” It is said to him: Then whoever claims that is a disbeliever. He is told: You must then say that the Throne has passed a period of time without Allah being in control over it because Allah has informed that He created the Throne before creating the heavens and the earth. Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, said: «And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, and His Throne was upon the water» [Quran 11:7]**

**So He informed that the Throne was upon the water before creating the heavens and the earth. Then He created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days, then Ar-Raḥmān Istawā (rose) over the Throne, so ask about Him one well informed (I.e the Prophet (ﷺ)). And His (Allah's) Ta‘ālā statement: «Those who bear the Throne and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord» [Quran 40:7], and His statement: «Then He Istawā (rose) towards the heaven, and made them seven heavens, and He is All-Knowing of everything» [Quran 2:29], and His statement: «Then He Istawā (rose) towards the heaven when it was smoke» [Quran 41:11]. So He informed that He Istawā (rose) over the Throne.**
 
**You must then say: The period during which the Throne existed before the creation of the heavens and the earth, Allah was not in control over it, since according to you, Istawā over the Throne means taking control. He supposedly took control at that time, not before.**

**And it has been narrated by ‘Imrān ibn Ḥuṣayn (رضي الله عنه) from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “Accept the good news, O Banū Tamīm.” They said: “You have given us good news, so give us [more].” He ﷺ said: “Accept the good news, O people of Yemen.” They said: “We have accepted, so tell us about the beginning of this matter, how it was.” He ﷺ said: “Allah was before everything, and His Throne was above the water, and He wrote in the Tablet the mention of everything.”**

**And it is narrated from Abū Razīn Al-‘Uqaylī, who pleased the Prophet ﷺ with his questions, that he said: “O Messenger of Allah, where was our Lord before He created the heavens and the earth?” He said: “He was in ‘amā (void), above it was air and below it was air, then He created His Throne above the water.”**

**Then he said, meaning the Jahmi: “Tell me how He Istawā over the Throne. Is it as it's said: Fulān Istawā (rose/ascended) over the bed, so the bed contains Fulān alone, if he is above it? Then you must say: The Throne contains Allah alone, when He is above it, for we don't understand a thing above a thing except in this way.”**

**Chapter on the explanation for that. It is said to him: As for your statement: ‘how did He rise?’ Then verily how is not applied to Allah, and He has informed us that He Istawā (rose) over the Throne, but He did not inform us how He Istawā (rose). It is obligatory for the believers to believe their Lord Istawā (rose) over the Throne and forbidden for them to describe how He Istawā (rose), because He did not inform them of how He did that, and the eyes did not see Him in this world to describe Him with what they saw, and it is forbidden for them to say about Him what they do not know.
So they believe in His news about His Istawā, then refer the knowledge of how He Istawā (rose), to Allah.**

**But you, O Jahmi, must say that: Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, is limited and that places contain Him if you claim in your assertion that He is in places, because nothing can be conceived in a place without the place containing it, as the Arabs say: Fulān is in the house, and water is in the jug, and the house contains Fulān, and the jug contains the water.**

**And you must accept something even more disgraceful than that, because you said something more terrible than what the Christians said, for they said that: Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, dwelled in Jesus, and Jesus is a human body, so they disbelieved by saying that. And it was said to them: How great is Allah, the Exalted, for you have placed Him in Mary's womb!**

**And you (the Jahmiyyah) say: that He is in every place, in the wombs of all women, in Jesus's body, and in the bodies of all people. And you must also say: He is in the stomachs of dogs and pigs, for they are places, and according to you, He is in every place. Exalted is Allah above that, a great exaltation!**

**When his statement became denounced, he (the Jahmi) said: I say that Allah is in every place, not like something inside something, nor like something above something, nor like something outside something, nor separate from something.
Chapter regarding the explanation for that: It is said to him: The basis of your statement is analogy and reason. You have shown by analogy and reason that you do not worship anything. Because if it were something, it would not be devoid of analogy and reason.**

**That something devoid of being inside something or outside of it. Since [according to your statement], there is nothing, it is impossible for it to be like a thing in a thing or outside of a thing. You have described something that does not exist; and this is your religion and the foundation of your statement is denial (of Allah's ﷻ attributes).**
